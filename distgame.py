    """A distributed game, ie. a multiplayer game of imperfect information.

    The imperfect information is modeled as an equivalence relation for each player
    such that any two states in the same equivalance class are indistinguishable to
    that player. These classes are denoted as indistinguishability classes.

    Since there are multiple players, a single move is decided by the joint actions of
    the entire coalation of players. A joint action is a tuple of the actions of every
    player.

    Note that the game may be non-deterministic. This is modeled by allowing a single
    move to lead to multiple successor states.

    Attributes:
        states: All state ids.
        state_names: All state names.
        inital_state: The initial state id.
        players: All player ids.
        joint_actions: A generator of all joint actions.

    Methods:
        __setitem__: Set a move, mapping a state and a joint action to successor states.
        __getitem__: Get the successor states mapped from a state and a joint action.
        get_actions: Return all the actions available to a player.
        are_distinguishable: Return whether a player can distinguish between two states.
        to_pydot: Return a pydot graph of the game.
